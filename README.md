#Install dependencies
npm install

# FoodFolio

1. Run `npx expo start` in terminal
2. Press `s` to make sure you run in expo go mode and not development
3. Scan with camera on the qr code and open app in expo go

Possible Issues:

-   `@react-native-clipboard` might cause issues so if it does, in EntryComponent try commenting the import statement out and restart

Useful commands:

-   `npx expo start --clear` (Clears cache)
-   `depcheck` (Checks for unused dependencies)
